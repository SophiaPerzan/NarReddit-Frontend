# NarReddit Web App

NarReddit, originally conceived as an automation script, has now evolved into a seamless web app. The NarReddit web app enables users to convert top-rated Reddit posts into captivating Subway Surfers-style TikTok narrations with just a few clicks. You can now effortlessly generate multilingual video content from trending Reddit posts without delving into scripts or installations!
